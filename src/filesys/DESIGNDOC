---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Describe how your cache replacement algorithm chooses a cache
>> block to evict.
If there is an empty slot (can be the case when less than 64 different sectors
have been accessed), then nothing is evicted and that slot is used. Otherwise,
each cache slot keeps track the the tick when it was last accessed. So when
finding a slot to evict, the code loops through the slots and looks for the
slot last accessed furthest back in time that is also permitted to be evicted
(ie not in use and not being evicted by someone else).

>> C3: Describe your implementation of write-behind.
There is a function that says while true sleep for FLUSH_FREQ and then loop 
through all slots writing out all dirty ones. cache_init starts a thread that
runs that function

>> C4: Describe your implementation of read-ahead.
When a sector is read in via normal access (ie not read-ahead), if the next sector
is in the file then an element with that sector number is added to the read ahead 
list. There is a function that says while true sleep for READ_AHEAD_FREQ and then 
go through the read ahead list and read in the sector in each element as if it had 
been accessed by a read or write, but with a flag that says to not add the next
sector to the read ahead list. cache_init starts a thread that runs that function 

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> C5: When one process is actively reading or writing data in a
>> buffer cache block, how are other processes prevented from evicting
>> that block?
Each slot has an in_use field. When a process needs to access a slot, it atomically
increments that field, does its stuff, and then atomically decrements that field.
Eviction is forbidden from choosing a slot with in_use greater than zero.

>> C6: During the eviction of a block from the cache, how are other
>> processes prevented from attempting to access the block?
When the eviction policy finds a slot it wants to evict, it atomically increments
the slot field trying_to_evict. Slot accesses are not allowed on slots with a
trying_to_evict field greater than zero, and eviction is not allowed to evict
a slot with a trying_to_evict field of greater than 1 (so that it doesn't evict
a slot and then hand it out to two different sector accesses).
If a slot access has started and then trying_to_evict is incremented, the slot
access continues without having to worry because before actually evicting the
slot, eviction will check that the slot isn't in use. Since the access would
have incremented in_use, then the eviction doesn't actually go through.

trying_to_evict is not reset until a new sector is read into the slot and 
last_used is set to the current timer tick, so that eviction doesn't think
it can evict a slot that was just evicted.

>> C7: Describe a file workload likely to benefit from buffer caching,
>> and workloads likely to benefit from read-ahead and write-behind.

Buffer caching is useful when the same sector is accessed over and over again.
If the sector is kept in cache, those accesses are faster than they would
otherwise be. For example, I write to this text file every thirty seconds, so 
my computer probably wants to keep it in cache to make writing faster.

Read ahead is good for lots of sequential accesses. I'm not quite sure if
this is a good example, but copying big files around might benefit from
read ahead. If copying is slow enough, by the time it gets to the next sector
the next sector will have already been read in. On the other hand, it seems
like copying would be too fast to get much advantage from it.

Write behind is good for not losing work when computers crash. It also helps
with eviction if it writes out a sector, making the slot no longer dirty, so
that when the slot is evicted then it doesn't need to waste time writing out
the sector.
